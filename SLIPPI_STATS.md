## General
- Inputs / Minute: The quantity of inputs divided by the quantity of minutes. Factors contributing to quantity of inputs: Buttons being pressed when they were not before, joystick or C-stick inputs transitioning between stick regions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, deadzone), or triggers passing the 30% threshold when they were less than 30% before. Each of these distinct factors will contribute a single input to the count. That is, each distinct dual state button will potentially contribute 1 input, each stick will potentially produce 1 input, and each trigger will potentially produce one input. Inputs are processed on a frame-by-frame basis.
